# Slim Skeleton Application
Simple skelleton for [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) I did for personal projects.

Any help are welcome.

2.
Install all dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Edit the PATH/src/config/config-example.php with your database configurations and change the name for config.php @@ OBS: DATABASE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

Set up your vhosts for slim-skeleton/public or run the following command and access by web browser
```
$ php -S localhost:3000
```
