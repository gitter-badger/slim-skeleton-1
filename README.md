# slim-skeleton
Simple skelleton for PHP [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) I did for myself.

Not finished but any help are welcome :)
Working currently in better router and database layer.

1.
Clone the repo into your PATH
```
$ git clone https://github.com/renatoaraujo/slim-skeleton.git
```

2.
Install all dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
```
$ composer install
```

3.
Edit the PATH/src/config/config-example.php with your database configurations and change the name for config.php

4.
To the example just run the script located in PATH/sql/example.sql

5.
Set up your vhosts for PATH/public or run the command and access by web browser
```
$ php -S localhost:3000
```
