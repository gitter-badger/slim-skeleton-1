# Slim Skeleton Application
Simple skelleton for [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) I did for personal projects.

You can use this skeleton application easily to create your awesome API's or websites.
You are welcome to collaborate and any suggestions please contact me.

Used for this project:
  - [Slim Framework 3](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim)
  - [Slim Twig View](https://github.com/slimphp/Twig-View)
  - [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)
  - [Doctrine ORM 2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html)

### Installation
Clone the repo into your PATH
```
$ git clone https://github.com/renatoaraujo/slim-skeleton.git
```

Run the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install dependencies and create the autoload for application
```
$ composer install
```

Create the config file just copying or changing the name of src/config/config-example.php to config.php. Note: in this file you will configure your database connection when it's ready.

Go to public/ folder and run the command
```
$ php -S localhost:3000
```
Or create your Nginx/Apache virtual host pointing to /public/index.php
